    text: "The only safe procedure for you, now that you have started, is to make sure from this day forward until the day you are buried, you do two things each day. First, master a difficult old insight, and second, add some new piece of knowledge to the world each day. Now does that seem extravagant?"

    text: "Once when I was trying to sell Mickey Mouse, a fellow told me something. He said, 'Mickey Mouse? What is it? Nobody knows it… They don't know you and they don't know your mouse.' That hit me. I said, from now on they're going to know. And I stuck Mickey Mouse so darn big on that title that they couldn't think it was a rabbit or anything else."

    text: "Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson."

    text: "On a given day, a given circumstance, you think you have a limit. And you then go for this limit and you touch this limit, and you think, 'Okay, this is the limit'. And so you touch this limit, something happens and you suddenly can go a little bit further. With your mind power, your determination, your instinct, and the experience as well, you can fly very high."

    text: "If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and don't think anything of personalities, or emotional conflicts, or of money, or of family distractions; if you just think of, detail by detail, what you have to do next, it is a wonderful dream even though the end is a long way off, for there are about five thousand steps to be taken before we realize it; and start taking the first ten, and stay making twenty after, it is amazing how quickly you get through those five thousand steps."

    text: "Whenever you do something new and think it is based on a new principle, you check it in two ways: one by taking other examples that seem to you to involve the same principles; and the other, if you are a good laboratory worker, I guess, is to try the opposite of what you believe and see if the principle is there when you do the opposite of what you believe."

    text: "You want to be almost alone, with just a few friends. You want to be undisturbed. You want to be free to think, not for an hour at a time, or three hours at a time, but for two days or two weeks, if possible, without interruption. You wish people would just go away and leave you alone while you get something straight."

    text: "I, like many of you artists out there, constantly shift between two states. The first is white-hot, 'in the zone' seat-of-the-pants, firing on all cylinders creative mode. This is when you lay your pen down and the ideas pour out like wine from a royal chalice. This happens about 3% of the time. The other 97% of the time I am in the frustrated, struggling, office-corner-full-of-crumpled-up-paper mode. The important thing is to slog diligently through this quagmire of discouragement and despair... In a word: PERSIST. PERSIST on telling your story. PERSIST on reaching your audience. PERSIST on staying true to your vision..."

  churchill5:
    text: "We have before us an ordeal of the most grievous kind. We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. You ask, what is our policy? I can say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our policy. You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival. Let that be realised; no survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward towards its goal. But I take up my task with buoyancy and hope. I feel sure that our cause will not be suffered to fail among men. At this time I feel entitled to claim the aid of all, and I say, 'come then, let us go forward together with our united strength.'"

  churchill7:
    text: "I have, myself, full confidence that if all do their duty, if nothing is neglected, and if the best arrangements are made, as they are being made, we shall prove ourselves once again able to defend our Island home, to ride out the storm of war, and to outlive the menace of tyranny, if necessary for years, if necessary alone. At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."

  sutskever0:
    text: "I will offer one bit of a useful state of mind, which — if one adopts it — makes everything much easier: to accept reality as it is, and to try not to regret the past, and try to improve the situation. And the reason I say it is because it's so hard to adopt it. It's so easy to think, 'Oh, like some bad past decision, or bad stroke of luck, something happened, something is unfair' — and it's so easy to spend so much time thinking like this. While it's just so much better and more productive to say, 'Okay, things are the way they are. What's the next best step?' And I find that whenever I do this myself, everything works out so much better. But it's hard. It's hard. It's a constant struggle with one's emotion, and that's why I mention it to you. Perhaps some of you will adopt it yourself. This is a reminder to adopt this mindset as best as one can — and also a reminder for myself."
