        &ldquo;The only safe procedure for you, now that you have started, is to make sure from this day forward until the day you are buried, you do two things each day. First, master a difficult old insight, and second, add some new piece of knowledge to the world each day. Now does that seem extravagant?&rdquo;

        &ldquo;Once when I was trying to sell Mickey Mouse, a fellow told me something. He said, &lsquo;Mickey Mouse? What is it? Nobody knows it&hellip; They don&rsquo;t know you and they don&rsquo;t know your mouse.&rsquo; That hit me. I said, from now on they&rsquo;re going to know. And I stuck Mickey Mouse so darn big on that title that they couldn't think it was a rabbit or anything else.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.&rdquo;
