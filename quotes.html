            &ldquo;The only safe procedure for you, now that you have started, is to make sure from this day forward until the day you are buried, you do two things each day. First, master a difficult old insight, and second, add some new piece of knowledge to the world each day. Now does that seem extravagant?&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Once when I was trying to sell Mickey Mouse, a fellow told me something. He said, &lsquo;Mickey Mouse? What is it? Nobody knows it&hellip; They don&rsquo;t know you and they don&rsquo;t know your mouse.&rsquo; That hit me. I said, from now on they&rsquo;re going to know. And I stuck Mickey Mouse so darn big on that title that they couldn't think it was a rabbit or anything else.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and don't think anything of personalities, or emotional conflicts, or of money, or of family distractions; if you just think of, detail by detail, what you have to do next, it is a wonderful dream even though the end is a long way off, for there are about five thousand steps to be taken before we realize it; and start taking the first ten, and stay making twenty after, it is amazing how quickly you get through those five thousand steps.&rdquo;

            &ldquo;Whenever you do something new and think it is based on a new principle, you check it in two ways: one by taking other examples that seem to you to involve the same principles; and the other, if you are a good laboratory worker, I guess, is to try the opposite of what you believe and see if the principle is there when you do the opposite of what you believe.&rdquo;
